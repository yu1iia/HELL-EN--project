# :heavy_check_mark: HELL-EN

A short-term team project by :one::three: _collaborators_. 

I was a ***Team Leader*** of the project (chosen by the teammates because of our previous common experience :blush:).

The website created from scratch by the [prototype in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/uZMUZ8GHY42eg9JUsomuVV/Hell-En-project?node-id=1%3A4&scaling=scale-down-width).</br>

The project was ready on time.
